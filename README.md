This GitHub repository contains a web application for calculating and generating feeding guides for pets. It allows you to input the old and new food amounts, number of times fed, and provides a comparison of nutrient density. The app handles mixed fraction inputs, converts them to decimal numbers, and calculates feeding amounts for different days based on ratios. The results are displayed on the webpage and can be easily printed or emailed.
